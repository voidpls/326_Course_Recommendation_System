# CS 326 Course Recommendation System

## CS Course Recommendation App - Team 6

### Project Description:
The user will input the courses they have already taken, and optionally any academic or career interests they have, and the app will recommend future courses they might be interested in.
The recommendations will also consider prerequisite/eligibility requirements to ensure only available courses are suggested.
A visual CS major course progress map will show completed courses, current courses, and suggested future courses to help students plan their academic path.
 
### Problem: 
Computer Science students often struggle to decide which courses to take next, especially given the complex web of prerequisites, eligibility requirements, and their personal academic or career interests.
Without clear guidance, students may miss beneficial courses, take courses out of order, or delay their graduation timeline. Existing resources like course catalogs lack personalization, making them difficult to navigate.
